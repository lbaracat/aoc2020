The problem now is finding missing number in a sequence.

Run:

for binary in $(sed s/F/0/g input.txt | sed s/B/1/g | sed s/L/0/g | sed s/R/1/g | sort ); do echo "$((2#${binary}))"; done > 0Dinput.txt

gives me the input.txt file converted to ID seats, sorted.

The problem said that's only one is missing. Some seats from back and front too. But I seated "between" two people - aka existing <myID-1> and <nyID+1>.

Take from the above list, the first and last numbers. Run:

seq 6 1 933 > true0D.txt

Will build an entire list - including my missing ID.

And finally:

diff <list of flightIDs> <list of all possible flightIDs>

diff 0Dinput.txt true0D.txt
705a706
> 711
