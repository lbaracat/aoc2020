# Advent of Code 2020
> https://adventofcode.com/2020/

### My attempts to solve every puzzle using only GO
| Day | Aprox time | Difficulty |
| --- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1 | 60 | 0 |
| 2 | 70 | 1 |
| 3 | 50 | 0 |
| 4 | 300 | 0 |
| 5 | 10 | -1 |

 - Difficulty level, from 0 (super easy) to 10 (insane)
 - Approx time in minutes taken to solve entire day (2 puzzles per day until now)

### Comments
 - Puzzle 1, first time using bufio.Scanner()
 - Puzzle 2, seems my parsing method was NOT the best way to solve. But worked.
 - I cheated Puzzle 3, part 2. Hard coded each slope and did the mult manually, thanks to Starship launch (scrub).
 - Puzzle 4, very time consuming code. Lots of details / validations. My passport struct strategy pays off.
 - Puzzle 5 was super super easy. No code needed, just some scripts.
