# Advent of Code 2020

### My attempts to solve every puzzle using only GO
| Day | Aprox time | Difficulty |
| --- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1 | 60 | 0 |
| 2 | 70 | 1 |
| 3 |    |   |

 - Difficulty level, from 0 (super easy) to 10 (insane)
 - Approx time in minutes taken to solve entire day (2 puzzles per day until now)

### Comments
 - Puzzle 1, first time using bufio.Scanner()
 - Puzzle 2, seems my parsing method was NOT the best way to solve. But worked.
