The problem - and the input file - is a binary list of numbers.

128 rows == 2⁷
8 columns == 2³

Multiplying rows by 8 is left shifting by 3.

It's a bynary of 2¹⁰.

Sort the file, take the greatest and convert to decimal.

F is 0. B is 1.
L is 0. R is 1.

`sort -r input.txt | tail`  gives me the last lines...
